"""Scope catalog for AI assistants over MCP.

The user picks a subset of these when creating an assistant in
``/settings/ai-assistants``. The catalog is family-coarse rather than
per-tool: a domain (``tasks``, ``time``, ...) splits into ``:read`` /
``:write`` and a small ``:danger`` bucket for ops that spend credits or
destroy data.

Enforcement (task c19f2f63, enabler B): the HTTP transport reads
``assistant.scope`` (a JSONB list) from the SECURITY DEFINER
``authenticate_agent_token`` lookup (migration 0059) and publishes it into
``server._PRINCIPAL_SCOPE``. Every concrete tool maps to one scope key in
``mcp.tool_scopes.TOOL_SCOPES``; the gateway gate rejects an ``execute_tool``
call outside ``scope`` and hides out-of-scope tools from ``search_tools`` /
``describe_tools`` (``server._scope_permits``). FAIL-CLOSED: a tool with no
mapping is denied to a scoped assistant (a drift-guard test keeps the map in
lockstep with the registry). Legacy bare ``agent_tokens`` rows (assistant_id
IS NULL) and the stdio / human-bearer paths keep their previous all-tools
access — the filter only bites a bound assistant that carries a scope list.

# The keys a member may delegate to a credential of their OWN, without an
# owner's approval, and the only shape of credential that may reach every

#
# Minting a long-lived bearer credential is owner-gated because such a
# secret outlives the session that created it and lives wherever the
# holder put it. That threshold is right for a general MCP assistant,
# whose default is close to everything. It is wrong for the browser
# panel, which the product tells every reader to install and which can do
# a fixed, narrow subset of what its holder can already do -- and the two
# statements have contradicted each other in the product for as long as
# the page has existed: the page said "installing this is not an
# administrative act" and the server refused anyone but the owner.
#
# The threshold therefore follows the CAPABILITY, not the label. A
# request for these keys and no others is self-service; a request for one
# key more is an assistant, and owner-gated as before. Nothing here can
# be gamed by a caller: asking for more moves the threshold up, and the
# provider string, which the caller does choose, decides nothing.
#
# This is a ceiling, never a grant. Every operation is still authorized
# against the holder's own role in the workspace named by the request, so
# a credential whose holder is a guest somewhere acts as a guest there.
#
# One key here is catalogued ``danger``: ``attachments:write``, because
# uploaded bytes leave the workspace boundary when they are read back. It
# is also the whole of "file the page you are on", which is the
# capability the panel exists for. The other danger keys -- the ones that
# spend credits or destroy data -- stay owner-granted, and a test pins
# that this list holds exactly the one exception.
