"""Scope catalog for AI assistants over MCP.

The user picks a subset of these when creating an assistant in
``/settings/ai-assistants``. The catalog is family-coarse rather than
per-tool: a domain (``tasks``, ``time``, ...) splits into ``:read`` /
``:write`` and a small ``:danger`` bucket for ops that spend credits or
destroy data.

Enforcement (task c19f2f63, enabler B): the HTTP transport reads
``assistant.scope`` (a JSONB list) from the SECURITY DEFINER
``authenticate_agent_token`` lookup (migration 0059) and publishes it into
``server._PRINCIPAL_SCOPE``. Every concrete tool maps to one scope key in
``mcp.tool_scopes.TOOL_SCOPES``; the gateway gate rejects an ``execute_tool``
call outside ``scope`` and hides out-of-scope tools from ``search_tools`` /
``describe_tools`` (``server._scope_permits``). FAIL-CLOSED: a tool with no
mapping is denied to a scoped assistant (a drift-guard test keeps the map in
lockstep with the registry). Legacy bare ``agent_tokens`` rows (assistant_id
IS NULL) and the stdio / human-bearer paths keep their previous all-tools
access — the filter only bites a bound assistant that carries a scope list.
