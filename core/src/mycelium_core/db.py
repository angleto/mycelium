    """``do_connect`` hook: retry connection CREATION with bounded backoff.

    SQLAlchemy retries nothing here. When a managed Postgres reached over the
    network resets the socket mid-TLS-handshake, that ``ConnectionResetError``
    propagates out of ``pool._create_connection`` and becomes a 500 on a
    request that never even ran a query. ``pool_pre_ping`` does NOT cover
    this: it validates a REUSED connection before handing it out, so it is a
    no-op on the creation path.

    Scope, stated plainly: this absorbs a SINGLE-EVENT failure -- one dropped
    handshake, a server a moment away from accepting connections again. It is
    not a circuit breaker and not an outage cure. If the server or the network
    path to it is refusing connections, every attempt fails, the bound below
    is exhausted (at worst ``db_connect_max_attempts`` x the per-attempt
    connect timeout) and the original driver exception surfaces unchanged.

    Why ``do_connect`` and not ``async_creator=``: this hook is handed the
    ``cargs``/``cparams`` SQLAlchemy already derived from the URL -- host,
    port, user, password, database, the ``ssl`` option, plus whatever
    ``connect_args`` added (our connect timeout). Delegating to
    ``dialect.connect(*cargs, **cparams)`` reproduces the stock connect
    EXACTLY: there is no DSN to re-parse and no way for a URL option to be
    silently dropped on the retry path. ``async_creator=`` would hand us an
    empty canvas and force us to rebuild the DSN by hand, which is how
    credentials and TLS options get lost.

    Greenlet semantics: ``do_connect`` runs inside SQLAlchemy's greenlet
    bridge (the asyncpg DBAPI adapter itself calls ``await_only`` under us),
    so the backoff sleep MUST be ``await_only(asyncio.sleep(...))`` -- a
    ``time.sleep`` here would block the event loop of every other in-flight
    request, i.e. turn one slow connect into a fleet-wide stall.

    Bounded in total wall clock: at most ``db_connect_max_attempts`` attempts,
    each capped by the asyncpg-level ``db_connect_timeout_seconds``, plus a
    full-jitter exponential backoff off ``db_connect_retry_base_seconds``. A
    request cannot hang here; it fails with the original driver exception.

def get_engine() -> AsyncEngine:
    """The process-wide async engine, with an EXPLICITLY sized pool.

    Explicit sizing makes this app's connection footprint on a managed
    instance shared with another project a KNOWN number. The ceiling below is
    10 + 5 = 15 per process, the same total SQLAlchemy's implicit defaults
    already gave us (5 + 10) and that production has run on; what changes is
    the SPLIT. Ten of the fifteen are now persistent instead of five, so a
    burst is served from already-open connections rather than from overflow
    connections, which are opened on the request's critical path and then
    discarded on return. Do not shrink the total below the worker's structural
    concurrency (~12 overlapping sweep loops, one session each), or normal
    operation turns into checkout timeouts.

    Connection budget. The premise, to re-derive if any of it changes: the
    instance is a Scaleway Managed Postgres ``db-dev-s`` with
    ``max_connections = 100``, shared with a co-tenant project, and Postgres
    keeps ``superuser_reserved_connections`` (3) aside. THREE processes hold
    one of these pools, one per deployment, each 1 replica x 1 process: the
    backend (uvicorn, no ``--workers`` in docker/backend.Dockerfile, with the
    MCP server mounted into the same app), the worker
    (``python -m mycelium_worker.main``) and sdi-inbound (uvicorn; its handler
    calls ``ingest_notification`` -> ``tenant_session``, so it holds a pool
    like the others).

        per-process ceiling   = pool_size + max_overflow = 10 + 5 = 15
        steady-state ceiling  = 3 pools x 15             =         45
        rolling-update ceiling= 6 pools x 15             =         90

    Those two totals are WORST CASES, not expectations: a QueuePool opens
    connections on demand and only reaches its ceiling under sustained
    concurrency, which the backend (single-digit requests per minute) and
    sdi-inbound (event-driven) never approach. The number to watch is the
    worker's, since it is the one with a dozen concurrent loops. The
    rolling-update line assumes every pool of both the old and the new pod
    saturated at the same instant, which is why it is a bound and not a plan:
    if it ever becomes real, lower MYCELIUM_DB_POOL_SIZE for the roll rather
    than discovering it as 53300.

    The invariant to preserve when scaling out: summed over the deployments,
    ``replicas x processes_per_replica x (pool_size + max_overflow) x 2`` must
    stay under ``max_connections - reserved - co-tenant share``. Adding a
    replica or a uvicorn ``--workers`` value WITHOUT lowering
    MYCELIUM_DB_POOL_SIZE breaks it, and the failure mode is 53300
    too_many_connections for everyone on the instance, us and the co-tenant
    alike. The knobs are per-deployment env vars: the worker and sdi-inbound
    do not need the backend's ceiling, so trimming theirs is the first lever
    when the instance gets tight.

    What this does and does not address. Sizing bounds the footprint and lets
    a burst be served by connections that are already open; the ``do_connect``
    retry absorbs a single-event connect failure; ``pool_pre_ping`` heals a
    connection killed while idle, one checkout at a time, which is also why
    there is no age-based ``pool_recycle`` window by default (see config.py).
    NONE of that is a defence against a database that stops admitting new
    connections at all -- a firewall/ACL change, a hard outage: every attempt
    then fails, the retry exhausts its bound, and the error surfaces. That
    failure mode is diagnosed on the server side, not survived here.

    """A no-tenant session: sets the actor kind but never ``app.current_org``.

    Used by the worker to enumerate workspaces before fanning out into a
    per-org ``tenant_session`` (and by bootstrap/migrations/tests). Under
    RLS this session is fail-closed for org-scoped tables EXCEPT the
    enumeration tables (``organizations``, ``memberships``,
    ``google_calendar_subscriptions``), which carry a ``FOR SELECT`` policy
    that opens to a system session with no current org (migration 0029).
    So a ``system`` caller can list every workspace and resolve its owner,
    yet still sees nothing in tasks/notifications/etc. until it narrows to
    a single org via ``tenant_session``.

    ``actor_kind`` defaults to ``system`` so audit rows from this path are
    attributed to a system actor and the enumeration policies apply;
    callers can override (e.g. a CLI acting for a specific operator), but a
    non-system kind sees no org-scoped rows at all (fail-closed).
