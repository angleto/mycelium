    # The split matters more than the total. 15 concurrent connections per

    # path and then threw those connections away. Moving the same ceiling to
    # 10 + 5 makes ten of them persistent, which is the whole point.
    #
    # Do not shrink the total below the structural concurrency of the WORKER
    # process: it runs ~12 sweep loops (dispatch, reminders, webhooks, the
    # search/embedding backfills, ...) whose ticks overlap, and each opens its
    # own session. A ceiling under that turns normal operation into checkout

    # the next burst of N concurrent checkouts finds N expired connections and
