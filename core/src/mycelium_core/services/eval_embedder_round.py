"""Embedder round: the same public benchmark, run once per candidate
embedder, compared against the incumbent with a paired statistic.

Why this exists as its own module rather than a flag on the bench: a
comparison needs something the plain bench does not, and it is the reason
the 2026-07-03 round (nota 3276b266 §4) could not settle the question it
asked. **A three-point spread over a few hundred questions needs an
interval.** July compared 0.726 / 0.713 / 0.696 recall with no paired test,
which cannot distinguish "in the same band" from "worse". Every candidate
here answers the SAME questions, so the comparison is naturally paired:
``eval_baselines.paired_stats`` (exact McNemar on discordant hits,
cluster-bootstrap CI on ΔMRR, clusters = bench instance) applies directly
and is reused rather than re-implemented.

The OTHER reason July could not answer is no longer this module's problem,
and the history is worth keeping because it explains a shape that is now
absent. Instruction-tuned retrieval models (Qwen3-Embedding, E5-instruct)
are trained with an instruction prefix on the QUERY side only; run without
it they are measured outside the configuration they were trained for, which
is how July scored them. That was first corrected here, in the bench: a
different embedder installed around each phase, wrapping the model in a
prefix. It measured a shape production could not reproduce, so a winning
candidate would have had to be measured again after adoption, and it rested
on an undocumented discipline (the phases run in sequence, the override is
process-global) that no test held. The asymmetry now belongs to the
``Embedder`` seam itself (``EmbedSide``, ADR-0061), where production uses it
too, and the prefix is read from the checkpoint's own configuration rather
than written beside the model id. This module installs ONE embedder per
candidate and lets the seam carry the side.

The promotion rule was strengthened on 2026-09-12, BEFORE this round ran and
with July's numbers as the only ones in view. July pre-registered "promote
only on a net improvement in recall AND MRR", which has no notion of noise:
it promotes on +0.005 as readily as on +0.05, and the cost of a wrong
promotion is not symmetric with the cost of a wrong hold: adopting a local
embedder re-embeds the entire corpus (ADR-0030) and does not undo cleanly.
:func:`verdict` therefore also requires the delta to be distinguishable from
noise (exact McNemar under a Bonferroni-corrected alpha, because a round
comparing several candidates against one incumbent makes several
comparisons) and to appear in the category the round is actually about.

That category is SINGLE-HOP, and naming it is the other half of the
pre-registration. The recall gap is not uniform (July: single-hop 0.763,
multi-hop 0.712, open-domain 0.472) and July already concluded that the
multi-hop gap is a graph problem rather than an embedding one. A candidate
that moved only multi-hop would be evidence about something this round
cannot change.

    A LOCAL candidate is a model id, a pin, and one claim. It carries no
    instruction prefix: the checkpoint declares its own in
    ``config_sentence_transformers.json`` and ``LocalEmbedder`` reads it
    there, so a spec file cannot state a prefix that disagrees with the
    model it names.

    ``mrl`` is the candidate's claim to Matryoshka training, and it is
    declared per candidate rather than read from the deployment because
    in a round the claim is evidence: a checkpoint wider than the fleet
    dim is truncated to reach it, and that is only principled for an MRL
    model. A wider candidate that does not declare it refuses to load,
    which is the intended outcome -- a number measured from a silently
    degraded model is worse than a missing row.

    ``provider`` names a HOSTED endpoint instead ("scaleway"), which is how
    a model too large to hold in the backend pod can still be measured
    against the incumbent: the vectors come over HTTP at the fleet width and
    every other part of the run -- the column, the model_id filter, the
    scoring path -- is the one production uses. The prefixes are declarable
    ONLY here, and only because there is no checkpoint to read: an
    ``/v1/embeddings`` endpoint serves a model without exposing its
    sentence-transformers configuration, so the instruction is knowable only
    from the model card. On a local candidate they are refused, because
    there the model already states it and a second copy would be the thing
    that drifts.

    ``revision`` does not apply to a hosted candidate and is refused there
    too: the endpoint serves whatever weights the provider has deployed, and
    a pin the run cannot enforce would be a reproducibility claim that is
