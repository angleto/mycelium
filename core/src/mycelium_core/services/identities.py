"""Identity service: lookups + lifecycle (docs/adr/0028).

Identity rows are populated lazily by the layers that create the

- ``ensure_for_user(org, user)`` is called from signup /

- ``ensure_for_ai_assistant(org, assistant)`` is called from

    different handle (e.g. backfilled by a migration to a UUID
