"""Closed-loop dispatch + approval gates (docs/adr/0025, P5).

The closed cycle that ties P1-P4 together:

    tick -> recompute (P1/P2 scheduler) -> read the admitted llm_agent
    set -> (governance gate) -> start runs via P3 -> [agent runs
    execute out-of-band; the P4 set_state hook fires handoffs on
    completion] -> next tick recompute picks up the new ready set.

This module is a PURE deterministic orchestration service. It does NOT
re-derive scheduling, admission, execution or coordination -- it calls:

- ``scheduler.recompute`` (P1/P2): the ONLY source of the feasible plan
  and the admitted/dispatchable assignment. The admitted llm_agent set
  is exactly the ``Schedule`` rows that are ``llm_agent``, NOT
  ``unassignable``, and carry an ``assigned_executor_id`` (the same
  notion ``agent_runtime._assigned_executor`` /
  ``coordination._resolved_executor`` use). Per-agent WIP
  (``max_parallel``) and Σ credit budget were already enforced by the
  scheduler's admission; the loop re-checks live in-flight runs as a
  defense-in-depth before each start.
- ``agent_runtime.start_run`` (P3): the ONLY execution path -- bounded,
  metered (idempotent ``agentrun:{run.id}:{step}``), killable, confined
  to the actor's effective RBAC. The loop never bypasses it.
- the P4 ``tasks.set_state`` -> ``coordination.on_task_completed`` hook
  fires the handoff fan-out on run completion; the loop only RESCHEDULES
  (recompute again) and picks the next batch.

Governance (ADR-0025 §Governance, non-negotiable): the default is
human-in-the-loop. ``tick`` NEVER spends credits / starts a run without
either an explicit per-dispatch ``approve`` (the API/MCP) OR an explicit
workspace opt-in to ``auto`` mode. ``auto`` removes the human click; it
does NOT remove the per-agent WIP cap, the credit budget, the tool
allowlist or the RBAC ceiling. Every privileged op (approve / deny /
policy change / manual tick) is owner-gated through the effective-role
choke point (``rbac.require_role(... owner)``), exactly like the P2
executor CRUD and the P3 run start (running an agent spends credits).

Determinism: the admitted set is processed in the SAME order the
scheduler uses -- scheduler priority is reflected by
``Schedule.scheduled_start`` (the leveled placement), with
``str(task_id)`` as the final stable tie-break (the deterministic-core
contract). Idempotent: a second ``tick`` with no state change creates
no duplicate ``dispatch_request`` and starts no duplicate run (the
at-most-one-active-request-per-task invariant + the P3
at-most-one-active-run guard). NON-FATAL per task: a failure starting
one task's run sets THAT request ``failed`` with a short ``reason`` and
the tick continues with the others -- one bad task never aborts the
tick.
