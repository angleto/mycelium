"""Core types of the retrieval pipeline (docs/adr/0005 + task `300084ac`).

The pipeline is a list of ``Stage`` invoked in order on a list of
``Candidate``. Each stage may add candidates (lexical/semantic
branches), reorder them (fusion/rerank), drop them (limit/dedupe), or
side-effect (access counter). The first stage receives an empty
candidate list; the final list returned by the executor is what the
caller sees.

The stages do NOT cross-communicate through hidden state: anything a
stage needs from a previous one travels through ``Candidate`` fields
(``scores_by_stage`` for per-branch ranks the fusion stage needs) or
through the shared ``RetrievalContext`` (org/project predicates, the
embedded query, embedder reference, channel filter).

Concurrency: today every stage is sequential. A future ``ParallelStages``
wrapper can run independent branches concurrently (e.g. lexical + dense
+ HyDE) without changing the Stage protocol; the executor stays
linear over the top-level list.
