"""Hierarchical memory service (docs/adr/0005, 0007, 0016, FR-8).

Hard isolation: every query carries the mandatory (org_id, project_id)

deterministic hybrid RRF (semantic cosine + lexical tsvector),
oversampled per branch, fused with k=60 and a stable tiebreak. Writing
an embedding is a metered cost operation (ADR-0019). The cold tier is
always queryable; the tier is a latency hint, never retention. GDPR

    the index blobs are cleaned by ORM/mapper listeners on the ORM
    paths, but a bulk ``DELETE`` bypasses them -- without this call a
    hard-deleted note/task would leave its full-text blobs orphaned AND
    retrievable forever. Erasing by provenance mirrors ``gdpr_erase``:
    a derived memory whose ONLY provenance was a purged source dies with
    it. That is deliberate for the sovereign paths (a human explicitly
    destroying data) and exactly why the AUTONOMOUS retention sweep does
    NOT use whole-entity pairs (see ``entity_revisions.
    hard_delete_soft_deleted``: §12, the timer must not destroy
    independent memories that merely cite a purged row). Internal
    primitive: no RBAC and no audit here -- callers gate and log. RLS
