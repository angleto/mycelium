"""A shared work note has to say who wrote each block, and when.

No session and no database: these are the pure dict-builders the MCP
note tools return, so what they drop can be asserted directly.

Why it matters, and it is two uses at once. A task's work note is the
scratch surface for work in progress -- the rough copy that outlives a
session whose context gets compacted away -- and it is also where
several agents append while the work is still running. Both ask the
same question of a part first, and neither is "what does it say":

  * resuming after compaction: which blocks arrived since I last looked?
  * a second agent joining: which of these are somebody else's?

``NotePart`` has carried ``created_at``/``updated_at`` since it was
written, and ``created_by`` since migration 0010. Both projections
dropped all three, so the only way to answer either question was to
pull every body into context -- which is exactly the cost the outline
exists to avoid.

These are regression tests, not coverage: each asserts a specific field
survives the projection, because the failure mode is a field going
quietly missing again in a serialiser nobody re-reads.
