"""The fleet embedding dims, as the LIVE columns actually declare them.

``mycelium_core.embed_dims`` is the single source every embedder and every
model reads, but a migration cannot import it: a migration is a historical
record and must keep meaning what it meant when it ran, so the DDL spells
the number out. That leaves exactly one seam where the constant and the
schema can drift apart, and drift there is silent in the worst direction:
the code coerces every vector to the constant, the column keeps its own
width, and the failure surfaces as a driver error on the next write with
nothing naming the cause. This asserts the agreement instead.

Read back from a live database rather than from the migration source,
because a migration that ran is the only evidence that counts: a hand-edited
column, a squashed revision or a partition created outside the migration all
produce a schema the source does not describe.

``memory_blobs`` is PARTITION BY HASH (org_id), so the parent's declaration
is not the whole answer -- a partition attached with a different width would
accept writes the parent's type check never sees. Every partition is checked
too, by the same rule.

Runs on the sync (owner) engine, like ``test_migrations.py`` and the other
structure gates; assumes the test DB is at ``alembic upgrade head``.
