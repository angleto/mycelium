"""Dynamic-toolset gateway over the full mycelium_mcp tool set.

Speakeasy "dynamic toolsets v2" pattern: the HTTP surface advertises
only three meta-tools — ``search_tools`` / ``describe_tools`` /
``execute_tool`` — instead of the ~140 concrete tools. The MCP
``tools/list`` payload drops from ~21k tokens to ~1k, which is the
single largest fixed cost an MCP client pays per conversation (input
schemas dominate the catalog). Tools are discovered semantically and
their schemas loaded on demand, so the client never carries schemas it
will not use.

The concrete tools stay registered on ``mycelium_mcp.server.mcp`` (the
internal *registry*): it is never served over HTTP here, but it owns
the canonical name -> (description, inputSchema, callable) mapping and
is still imported directly by the test suite and by the stdio
entrypoint (``main.py``), which keeps the legacy token-based flow.

Auth: the bearer middleware (``server_http``) validates the
``mycelium_at_…`` token and publishes the principal into ``_PRINCIPAL``
before dispatch. ``execute_tool`` injects the (now redundant)
``token``/``org_id`` tool args as empty strings, so the LLM never sees
or provides them — this also closes the ``org_id="me"`` magic-literal
ergonomics gap. The meta-tools themselves touch no tenant data and need
no auth args (the HTTP bearer still gates every request).
