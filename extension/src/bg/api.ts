// The only place in this extension that reaches the network.
//
// Everything else asks the worker, and the worker asks the server. That
// is what makes the on/off switch a guarantee rather than a hope: there
// is one function to gate, and gating it provably stops every outbound
// request. It is also why no CORS grant is needed on the server -- the
// worker's host permission covers its fetches, so the deployment's
// allowlist, which also fronts the machine-to-machine surfaces, does not
// have to learn about a browser-controlled origin.
//
// Four things happen here and nowhere else:
//
//   a deadline          fetch has none of its own and will wait as long
//                       as the network will, holding a promise, a loading
//                       state and whatever the panel mounted around it;
//   a correlation id    minted per request and sent, so one user action
//                       that fans out is one thread through the server's
//                       log, and a timeout -- which has no response to
//                       read -- still resolves in the access log if the
//                       request arrived;
//   failure mapping     one status-to-code translation, so a caller
//                       branches on a stable code and never on prose;
//   the 401 answer      an agent token has no refresh, so there is
//                       nothing to retry and the credential is dropped.
