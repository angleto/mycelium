// The extension never sees a password and never mints anything itself. It
// opens the app's own settings page with a nonce, the person approves
// there -- where the app can show them exactly what is being granted, in
// the server's own words -- and the app hands back a credential scoped to
// that grant.
//
// The handover arrives over `externally_connectable`, which means Chrome
// fills in the sender's origin and the page cannot claim to be somewhere
// it is not. The alternative, a content script on the app origin talking
// by postMessage, would put our code inside the page that holds the
// human's own session in localStorage. This way the extension cannot read
// that page at all.
