// The seam between the panel documents and the service worker.
//
// The panels render and take input. The worker owns the credential, every
// fetch, every cache and the on/off switch. Nothing crosses that line
// except a message described here, and the map below is what makes the
// crossing checkable: `send` reads the request and response types off the
// operation name, so a call site cannot pass the wrong arguments or
// misread the answer.
//
// Why the worker owns it all, since the panels are the same origin and so
// this is not a trust boundary:
//
//   - the omnibox handler fires in the worker and nowhere else, so search
//     living in a panel would mean two implementations of one rule;
//   - Chrome destroys the popup the instant it loses focus, and a write
//     issued from there has an unknown outcome. Issued by the worker, it
//     completes. That is the promise: you may close the panel mid-write;
//   - one module then owns every stored key and the single function that
//     clears them;
//   - and there is exactly one place that can reach the network, which is
//     what makes the on/off switch a guarantee rather than a hope.
