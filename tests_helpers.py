"""Cross-package test helpers (importable from any tests/ tree).

Pytest's rootdir is the workspace root (where ``pyproject.toml`` lives)
and gets added to ``sys.path`` automatically, so tests in
``api/tests/``, ``core/tests/``, ``mcp/tests/`` can ``from
tests_helpers import ...`` without any conftest gymnastics.

Kept intentionally minimal --- only the helpers that two or more test
packages would otherwise duplicate.

    The identity row is materialised by the migration-0085 after-insert

    --- so we mint a unique handle inline rather than going through
    ``ai_assistants_svc.create_assistant`` (which is owner-gated and
    also mints an agent_token we don't need here).

    ``scope`` ``None`` seeds ``_TEST_CAPABLE_SCOPES`` (every non-danger key, so
    the seeded agent can read AND write), NOT the product ``DEFAULT_SCOPES``
    (reads-only since the taxonomy review): tests want a working assistant, and
    decoupling keeps a policy change from silently breaking every write test.
    An empty list is a deliberate deny-all assistant; the model treats ``[]`` as
    "no scopes", matching the gate's fail-closed default. Pass an explicit subset
    to seed a narrowly-scoped assistant.

    Tests that exercise the scheduler / dispatch agent paths use the
    returned identity as ``assignee_id`` so the task is unambiguously
    routed to the llm_agent pool under the "default assignee = creator"
