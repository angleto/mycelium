# MCP coverage

The MCP surface is the agent-facing control plane, **co-equal to the REST
API** (docs/adr/0001): `mcp/` is a thin adapter over `core/`, so every
capability here has a REST sibling and vice-versa. A GUI- or REST-only
capability is a genuine gap, not an asymmetry by design.

Over HTTP the surface is the three-meta-tool **dynamic-toolset gateway**
(`search_tools` → `describe_tools` → `execute_tool`, see
`mcp/src/mycelium_mcp/gateway.py`): the LLM discovers tools semantically
instead of carrying every input schema per turn. The legacy stdio
entrypoint (`mcp/src/mycelium_mcp/main.py`) still exposes the concrete tools
directly, and the test suite imports the registry the same way.

**This document is half generated, half curated.** The tool inventory
between the markers is emitted from the live registry by
`scripts/gen_mcp_coverage.py` (run `make mcp-coverage` to refresh); CI fails
if it drifts (`make mcp-coverage-check`). The decision table, scope model
and gap notes around it are hand-written — they encode design intent the
registry cannot.

## Discovery decision table

Pick the tool by the **shape of the question**, not by enumerating a list
and filtering client-side. Each row routes one discovery need to its
canonical tool; the notes give the load-bearing parameter.

| I need… | Tool | Parameter |
|---|---|---|
| tasks in a given workflow state | `list_tasks` | `state_id=` |
| tasks by tag / project | `list_tasks` | `tag_id=` (org-wide unless project-scoped) |
| tasks by due / start / updated window | `list_tasks` | `due_before` / `due_after` / `start_after` / `updated_since` |
| tasks assigned to / owned by someone | `list_tasks` | `assignee_handles=` / `owner_handles=` |
| ranked free-text across tasks + notes + memory | `search` | `kinds=` to narrow |
| notes by free-text or title | `list_notes` | server-side `q=` over the whole corpus |
| “what should I do now”, time-boxed plan | `what_can_i_do_now` | deterministic advisory planner |
| errands near a place | `errands` | location-aware task slice |
| an entity from a short id prefix | `resolve_prefix` | ADR-0038 uuid-prefix → entity |
| recall from long-term memory (humus) | `memory_search` | hybrid retrieval over `memory_blobs` |
| a note’s graph neighbourhood | `graph_focus_context` | personalized-PageRank reading set |
| comments / suggestions on a doc | `list_annotations` | `doc_kind` + `doc_id`, `include_resolved=` |

The old “`list_tasks` filters by `state_id` only — use the SPA for
tag/date/text” gap is **closed**: `list_tasks` now takes `tag_id`,
free-text `q`, the due/start/updated date windows and assignee/owner
handles (see the generated `tasks` section below). An agent never needs to
over-fetch the org table and filter in its head.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: mcp tool inventory (scripts/gen_mcp_coverage.py) -->
**258 tools across 14 domains.** This inventory is generated from the live registry by `scripts/gen_mcp_coverage.py` — do not edit by hand; run `make mcp-coverage` to refresh. The one-line summary is each tool's first docstring line, so it cannot drift from the code.

## Scope model (advisory)

Every tool maps to a scope key in `SCOPE_CATALOG`
(`core/src/mycelium_core/mcp_scopes.py`) — the single source of truth, in
three buckets: **read**, **write**, **danger**. Enforcement is still
advisory (the per-tool gate is the deferred item flagged in
`mcp_scopes.py`); the safe default once flipped is “key missing → off for
any non-legacy assistant” (principle of least authority). The binding
follows a **most-specific** rule: a tool that mutates a task while touching
a tag is `tasks:write`, not `tags:write`, because the mutation lives on the
task row.

## Service capabilities not (yet) on MCP

Whole subsystems that live in `core/src/mycelium_core/services/` with zero
MCP surface — most by design, a few real gaps. (Per-tool gaps are not
tracked here any more: the generated inventory above is the source of truth
for what exists, and chasing line numbers was the drift this doc kept
accumulating.)

- **Auth / MFA** (`auth.py`, `mfa.py`): signup, login, password reset, TOTP
  setup. Out of scope by definition — the agent arrives *with* a token.
- **Memberships** (`memberships.py`): list / add / remove members, role
  changes. A multi-user workspace would want a `members:*` family; the
  single-operator build does not need it yet.
- **Agent-token / AI-assistant lifecycle** (`agent_tokens.py`,
  `ai_assistants.py`): minting tokens and binding scopes configures *the MCP
  transport itself* — chicken-and-egg, kept REST-only.
- **Binary attachment upload / download**: multipart bytes do not survive
  JSON-RPC; the streaming gateway (REST + capability tokens) owns the bytes.
  MCP keeps metadata reads and the capability-token mint only.
- **SdI / passive-email side channels** (`sdi_*`, `email.access_token_for`):
  internal to the invoice and mail pipelines, not user-facing.
- **Admin-mode elevation**: `X-Admin-Mode` / sudo is an HTTP-header pattern;
  MCP gates the equivalent inline on the `users.is_admin` capability.

A capability that has a REST route *and* a clear agent use-case but no MCP
tool is a real gap — file it as a task rather than letting it rot in prose
here.
