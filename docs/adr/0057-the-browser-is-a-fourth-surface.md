# ADR-0057: The browser is a fourth surface, and it holds a scoped credential

Status: Accepted (2026-09-03)

Relates to: ADR-0001 (one domain, thin adapters — this is a fourth adapter and
holds no business logic), ADR-0003 (the unified typed tag, which is what a
focus is), ADR-0017 (English-only source and message catalogues), ADR-0035
(search-click telemetry, which this surface must emit or it drags the recall
sensor down for everyone), ADR-0038 (the UUID-prefix resolver, which is the
panel's fastest branch), ADR-0050 (a task carries exactly one client and one
project). Surfaces table in `docs/cli.md`; user- and operator-facing
statement in `docs/extension.md`.

## Context

Mycelium's fastest path from "I am reading something" to "it is in my system"
runs entirely inside the app: open a tab, wait for the SPA, press Cmd+K,
search, click. Every step needs the app to be the thing in front of you, and
the one thing the SPA structurally cannot do is read the page you are
actually on.

Three facts about this codebase shaped the answer more than any preference:

- **A focus is one tag id, not a list.** `services/tag_assignment._apply`
  gives every task both its client tag and its project tag, and the memory
  tag filter is a faceted AND — an entity must carry every requested tag. So
  the SPA's `scopeTagIds` (`[client, ...its projects]`) sent to `POST /search`
  matches nothing at all. That shape is compensation for
  `advisory.what-now`'s OR matching, not a domain rule, and copying it into a
  second client would have produced an empty panel with no error.

- **Two permissions were each doing two jobs.** `workflows:write` meant both
  "advance one task" and "create, edit and delete the state machine every
  task runs on"; `tags:write` meant both "file a task into an existing
  project" and "invent, rename and rescope the vocabulary every entity
  carries". A client that needed the small power had to be granted the large
  one, so a least-privilege browser credential was not expressible.

- **A scoped credential could not ask what it may do.** `GET /auth/me` and
  `GET /workspaces` are `HUMAN_ONLY` and rightly so, and MCP's `whoami` is a
  tool. A scoped client that speaks only HTTP had to hardcode the scope list
  it was minted with, which drifts silently the moment anyone edits the
  assistant in Settings.

The credential question had one further constraint that removed most of the
options: the app keeps the human's session JWT and its 90-day refresh token
in `localStorage` on its own origin. Any design placing extension code inside
that page can read them.

## Decision

**A Chrome MV3 extension in `/extension/`, a separate package with its own
lockfile, outside any pnpm workspace.** It ships no runtime dependency at
all: the panel is plain TypeScript over the DOM, which keeps a surface that
must paint between keystrokes from carrying a renderer and a router. The
whole package is 18 kB of worker and 11 kB of panel.

**The service worker is the only network point and the only token holder.**
Not a trust argument — the panels are the same origin — but four practical
ones: the omnibox handler exists only there, so search elsewhere would be two
implementations of one rule; Chrome destroys the popup on focus loss and a
write issued from it has an unknown outcome, while one issued by the worker
completes; one module then owns every stored key and the single function that
clears them; and the CORS exemption is a `host_permissions` property that is
only unambiguous in the worker. The dividend is that the on/off switch,
checked at that one seam before the handler table, is a provable guarantee
that nothing leaves the browser.

**A connect handshake over `externally_connectable`, minting a scoped agent
token.** The extension opens `/settings/extension` on the app origin with a
single-use nonce; the person approves there, where the app renders the exact
grant from `GET /ai-assistants/scope-catalog`; the app mints via
`POST /ai-assistants` and hands the secret back as a structured clone. Chrome
fills in the sender's origin, which the page cannot forge, and the extension
gets zero read access to that page. **There is no content script at all**, on
any origin including the app's own.

**An agent token is confined to the workspace it was minted for.** The claim
was already in the token and every client already believed it -- the CLI
stores a workspace beside each credential and refuses to switch -- but the
server took the tenant from the header, so the per-workspace model was a
convention held up by clients. Both functions that open a tenant now compare
the two, and a mismatch is a 403 naming the credential rather than a 404
hiding the workspace.

**A capture that timed out does not become two.** The invoice API's
idempotency claim is widened with a second principal: a person acting in a
workspace, keyed with `org_id`, alongside the issuer it already had. The
header is optional on `POST /tasks` and `POST /notes`, because every client
that exists creates without one; what it buys is a client that cannot tell a
create which never arrived from one whose answer was lost.

**Two permissions are split so the grant can be small**: `tasks:state` out of
`workflows:write`, and `tags:assign` out of `tags:write`, each with a
transitional any-of set on both the REST and the MCP maps so a credential
granted the wide key before the split keeps working. The extension holds
eleven keys and cannot read the account, enumerate other workspaces, create
or rename clients and projects, edit workflows, or delete anything.

**`GET /agent/self` answers what a credential is**, under a new `META`
sentinel — authenticated and tenant-scoped, callable under any scope
including the empty one. This supersedes half of a decision recorded in
`route_scopes.py`: `/auth/me` stays `HUMAN_ONLY`, and META answers the
narrower question of what the CREDENTIAL is rather than who the person is.

**Rules that belong to the API rather than to a client move to
`web/src/shared/`**, compiled into both packages: the error envelope reader,
the entity-code contract, the recents contract, the search-click payload, the
query grammar's tokenizer and key set, the connect handshake, and the
generated `schema.d.ts`. `web/scripts/check-shared-purity.mjs` refuses any
import that leaves that directory and any deep import into it.

## Consequences

The switch is real rather than decorative, and the tests say so: with it off,
every operation but the switch and the connection is refused at the seam, and
the context menus Chrome persists across restarts are torn down with it.

An extension built against a development server **cannot receive a
credential**. Chrome refuses an `externally_connectable` pattern whose host
has no second-level domain, so `localhost` cannot appear in one. The manifest
omits the entry and the panel says the build cannot connect, rather than
offering a button that can never succeed.

The build has no default origin. One environment variable decides which
deployment the package talks to, which origin it may fetch from and which may
hand it a credential, so a package cannot be permitted to reach one
deployment while its code talks to another.

Two lockfiles is the price of the boundary, and it is what makes the boundary
real: React is not merely unused in `extension/`, it is not installable.

The extension emits `POST /search/click` for ranked opens only. A surface
that opened ranked results without emitting it would not merely lose a
metric, it would drag the recall figure down for every other surface.

**What the design does not protect against**, written here and repeated on
the connect page and in `docs/extension.md`: anything running as the user's
Chrome profile, since `chrome.storage.local` is an unencrypted database in
the profile directory; a compromised update of the extension itself; and a
browser already compromised at connect time.

Two transitional any-of sets now exist, dated and with a removal date of
2026-12-01. Left in place the splits are decorative, because everything keeps
working with the wide key and nothing ever moves off it.

## Alternatives rejected

**A password login in the popup**, which the sibling project's extension does
and which its own ADR calls phishing-shaped. It would land the extension
holding a credential that can mint more credentials, and re-implementing the
MFA challenge, the lockout and the verify branch would be a second
implementation of the login state machine.

**Pasting a personal access token.** `POST /agent-tokens` yields
`assistant_scope = None`, which the gate treats as no restriction: the full
authority of the user. The secret would also transit the clipboard.

**`chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` against the existing OAuth shim.** Dead
on a fact rather than a preference: `routers/oauth.py` requires
`client_secret` in the token request and returns it back as the access token,
and its authorize endpoint authenticates nobody. The caller must already hold
the secret before the flow starts.

**A content script on the app origin, handing over by `postMessage`.** It
would put our code inside the page that holds the human's session and refresh
token in `localStorage`, to save nothing: `externally_connectable` gives a
sender origin Chrome fills in, which is a stronger check than one we would
write ourselves.

**Widening `MYCELIUM_CORS_ORIGINS` to `chrome-extension://<id>`.**
Unnecessary — the worker's host permission covers its fetches — and it would
put a browser-controllable origin on an allowlist that also fronts the
invoice API and the MCP endpoint.

**Widening `GET /workspaces` or `GET /auth/me` away from `HUMAN_ONLY`.**
Enumerating a user's workspaces is a property of the account, not of a
workspace-bound credential; widening it would let a credential scoped to one
workspace learn the ids and names of the others. The connect page hands the
workspace over with the secret instead, so the extension never enumerates.

**An in-page overlay on `<all_urls>`.** Prettier, and it would put our code
in every page the user visits and an "read your data on all websites" warning
in front of every installer, to replace a panel that a keystroke already
opens.

**Reusing the SPA's i18next catalogue.** The objection to Chrome's own
`_locales` was that `chrome.i18n` follows the browser UI language while the
app follows its own, so the panel could show one language wrapped around a
server sentence in another. That objection is removed by deriving
`Accept-Language` from the same source, and `_locales` then needs no
cross-package import and no second copy of the key checker.

**A pnpm workspace with `web/`, `extension/` and a shared package.** The tidy
answer, rejected on four concrete costs: a workspace has one root lockfile,
which breaks `cache-dependency-path: web/pnpm-lock.yaml` in two CI jobs, the
frontend Dockerfile's three-file COPY, `web/.npmrc`'s per-package
justifications, and `pnpm install` under `working-directory: web`. Revisit
when a third JavaScript consumer appears.

**The cursor envelope on `GET /tasks`.** The route gained `ids`, `q`,
`limit`, `order_by` and the date windows the service had always accepted, but
not the `{items, next_cursor, truncated}` envelope: that is a breaking change
to a response every client reads, and its real blocker is that the SPA's
tasks route filters client-side over the fat `TaskOut` — moving that
filtering server-side is its own piece of work. Recorded as a gap rather than
half-done.
