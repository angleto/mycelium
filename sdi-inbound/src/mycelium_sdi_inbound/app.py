"""SDI inbound service.

Per docs/adr/0011 this is an always-on, mutual-TLS endpoint SdI pushes to.
Mutual TLS is enforced at the edge (Traefik TLSOption.clientAuth); this app
sees plain HTTP behind it. Two payload shapes hit the same path:

- **Active cycle** (notifications on invoices WE transmitted): RC, MC, NS,
  AT. Routed to ``mycelium_core.services.sdi_inbound.ingest_notification``.
- **Passive cycle** (FatturaElettronica WE receive as cessionario): routed
  to ``mycelium_core.services.sdi_passive.ingest_passive_invoice``. The
  RiceviFatture wrapper carries IdentificativoSdI + NomeFile + base64
  File; the inner FatturaElettronica.CodiceDestinatario resolves the
  recipient IssuerProfile -> org.

A single endpoint instead of two because the AdE portal lets us declare
the same URL for both Trasmissione and Ricezione, and a router predicate
based on the root element keeps the routing local + observable.

The exact SOAP ``esito`` response shape is verified against the WSDL at
accreditation (F7c); until then a 200 acks any successful ingestion and an
unparseable payload gets a 400 (never a 500, so SdI's retry/log path stays
clean).
