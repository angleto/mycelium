// Rules shared by every browser client of Mycelium.
//
// Two packages compile this directory: the SPA (web/) and the browser
// extension (extension/). Both are thin adapters over the same REST API,
// and a handful of rules are properties of that API rather than of
// either client: how its error envelope reads, what an entity code looks
// like, what a recents row is, what the search-click payload contains,
// and what the query grammar's tokens mean. Written twice, those drift,
// and each drift is invisible until someone's query returns the wrong
// rows or an error renders as [object Object].
//
// THE PURITY RULE. Nothing here may import anything outside this
// directory. Not React, not i18next, not the API client, not
// localStorage, not chrome.*. A module that reaches one of those cannot
// be compiled into the other package, and the failure is not a build
// error you would notice while working on the SPA -- it is a build error
// somebody else meets later. web/scripts/check-shared-purity.mjs makes
// it mechanical.
//
// The consequence is a shape, and it is the point: everything here takes
// what it needs as an argument and returns a value. Storage, transport,
// catalogues and clocks belong to the caller, so each client keeps its
// own and neither has to pretend to be the other.
//
// THE ENTRY POINT RULE. This barrel is the only path a consumer outside
// web/src/shared may import. Deep imports are refused by the extension's
// lint configuration, so the surface stays something that can be changed
// without auditing two packages.
