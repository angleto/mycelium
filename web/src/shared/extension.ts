// The contract between the app and the browser extension.
//
// Both sides need the same answers and neither can be the authority: the
// app MINTS the credential and must disclose exactly what it is granting,
// the extension RECEIVES it and must be able to say what it holds. Written
// twice, the disclosure and the grant drift, and the direction that drift
// takes is always the same one -- the consent screen keeps saying what the
// grant used to be.
//
// Pure by contract: this directory is compiled into both packages and
// imports nothing.

/** The scopes the extension asks for, and nothing beyond them.

 *  Each line is a capability the panel actually uses. Two are deliberately
 *  ABSENT and the absence is the design:
 *
 *  - ``workflows:write`` would let it delete the state machine every task
 *    in the workspace runs on. Advancing one task is ``tasks:state``.
 *  - ``tags:write`` would let it invent, rename and rescope the taxonomy.
 *    Filing a task into a client or project that already exists is
 *    ``tags:assign``.
 *
 *  Both narrow keys exist because this list was written: the wide ones were
 *  each doing two jobs, and a client that needed the small power had to be
 *  granted the large one. */
