"""Per-route scope map for the REST surface (task c19f2f63, enabler B).

The MCP gateway gates every tool against the calling assistant's scope. The
SAME ``mycelium_at_`` tokens also authenticate here, so without an equivalent
map a scoped assistant closes the MCP client and regains full access over
HTTP -- the boundary would be a preference, not a permission. This module is
the REST analogue of ``mcp.tool_scopes.TOOL_SCOPES``, and the two are kept
deliberately consistent: the route and the tool that perform the same
operation require the same key.

Each ``(METHOD, path-template)`` maps to one of:

- a scope key from ``core.mcp_scopes.SCOPE_CATALOG`` -- callable by an
  assistant that was granted it;
- ``PUBLIC`` -- no bearer required at all (health, docs, login, OAuth
  callbacks), so there is nothing to gate;
- ``HUMAN_ONLY`` -- authenticated, but never callable by a scoped assistant
  no matter which scopes it holds. This is the privilege-escalation fence:
  account/session/MFA, workspace and member administration, and above all
  the credential and assistant routes, since an assistant that can PATCH its
  own row could simply widen its own scope and undo the whole boundary.

FAIL-CLOSED: a route absent from the map is denied to a scoped assistant. A
drift-guard test asserts the map covers the live route table exactly, so a
newly added route fails CI instead of silently becoming unreachable (or, if
the default were open, silently becoming a hole).

Only a BOUND assistant carrying a scope list is ever restricted: bare agent
tokens and human session JWTs are unaffected, exactly as on the MCP side.

Cross-surface classification decisions (the workflow that built this map
flagged these as "do not leave undecided"; recorded here so they are not
re-litigated per route):

- ``GET/PATCH /auth/me`` are HUMAN_ONLY even though MCP ``whoami`` is a META
  tool callable under any scope. They are NOT the same operation: ``whoami``
  is a purpose-built agent bootstrap returning a curated identity subset,
  while ``/auth/me`` reads and mutates the raw user-account row (email,
  avatar, admin flag). A scoped assistant bootstraps over MCP ``whoami``; it
  has no reason to touch the account row. No META sentinel is added to this
  module -- the only always-callable identity path is the MCP one.

- ``POST /capability/text-block`` is HUMAN_ONLY, not a stopgap. It mints a
  ``mycelium_cap_`` token, and a capability token authenticates on a branch
  that carries no ``assistant_scope`` (``current_claims_optional`` returns
  ``{}`` for cap tokens). Letting a scoped assistant mint one is a laundering
  step from a scoped identity to an unscoped credential, so the mint itself is
  fenced off. (Redeeming a cap token minted by a human is unaffected: the
  gate below no-ops for cap tokens.)

- ``POST /notes/{note_id}/task-links`` and ``POST /tasks/{task_id}/note-links``
  multiplex ``kind=subject`` (a notes:write operation on MCP) and
  ``kind=artifact`` (tasks:write) through one endpoint; a single key cannot
  express both. Resolved (review #5): they map to the any-of frozenset
  ``LINK_WRITE_ANY`` (holding either write key passes the coarse gate) and the
  handler calls ``deps.require_agent_scope`` to enforce the exact per-kind key,
  matching the two separate MCP tools. No route split / API change needed.

- ``GET|PATCH|POST /annotations/{id}/body/*`` are mapped to the
  ``annotations:*`` family, which is correct. MCP models the same bytes under
  ``tasks:*`` via ``*_text_block_capability(kind='annotation')`` -- that is the
  MCP side being wrong (an annotations-only assistant is denied its own
  comment body while a tasks-only one is granted it). The REST map does not
  inherit the MCP bug; the MCP-side split is tracked separately.

- Read-only notification routes fall onto ``notifications:write`` because the
  catalog has no ``notifications:read`` key (neither surface does). Requiring
  MORE scope to read is fail-safe, not a hole; adding the read key is a
  taxonomy change awaiting sign-off.
