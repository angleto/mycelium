"""Unified search across tasks, notes and memory blobs.

Wraps the existing memory RRF pipeline with a kind-aware split: ``task``
kind uses the org-wide retrieve (project_id=None) and resolves blobs to
tasks via ``task_index_pointer``; ``note`` kind resolves note-part blobs
to their note via ``note_part_index_pointer`` (per-project); ``blob``
kind keeps the per-project predicate. Snippet is computed server-side via
Postgres ``ts_headline``; the response is typed.
