"""What this credential is, for the client holding it.

The REST twin of the MCP ``whoami`` META tool, and it exists because a
scoped client that speaks only HTTP had no way to ask.

Without it a client hardcodes the scope list it was minted with. That
list drifts the moment anyone edits the assistant in Settings, and the
drift is silent in the worst direction: the client keeps offering a
control the server will refuse, which is the failure mode of advertising
a capability that does not exist. It is also the only way to tell "my
credential was revoked" from "the network is down" without probing some
unrelated endpoint and interpreting the failure, which is guessing.

DELIBERATELY NOT ``/auth/me``. That route reads the raw user-account row
-- email, avatar, the admin flag -- and stays HUMAN_ONLY, because an
assistant has no reason to touch a person's account. This answers a
different question: not "who is the human", but "what is this credential
and what may it do". The account is named only by the identity the
workspace already publishes to its collaborators.

META in ``route_scopes``: callable under any scope, including the empty
one, because a client cannot ask what it may do if asking is itself
gated. It is still authenticated and still tenant-scoped, so it leaks
nothing to a caller without a valid token, and nothing about a workspace
the caller is not a member of.
