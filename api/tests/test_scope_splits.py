"""Two permissions were each doing two jobs. These assert the split held.

``workflows:write`` meant "advance one task" AND "create, edit and delete
the state machine every task in the workspace runs on". ``tags:write``
meant "file this task into a project that exists" AND "invent, rename and
rescope the vocabulary every entity carries". A client that needed the
small power had to be granted the large one, which is not a permission
system, it is a hint.

Both splits ship a TRANSITIONAL any-of set so an assistant granted the
wide key before the split keeps working. The risk that creates is that
the split becomes decorative: everything still works with the wide key,
so nothing ever moves off it, and the narrow key is never granted. The
sets carry a removal date; these tests are what makes collapsing them
safe, because they pin what the narrow key must and must not reach.

No database: these are assertions about the two maps and the two gates.
